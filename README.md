# BLUE: Best Linear Unbiased Estimator

`blue` is a pure python class that implements the BLUE method using the power of
`pandas` and `numpy`. 

This code has not been used for any scientific publications so far, but several
existing combinations are repeated as examples in the documentation as jupyter
notebooks.

## Examples

Previous analyses that have used the BLUE method (but not this code) are
reproduced in the docs. You can interact with these using binder:
